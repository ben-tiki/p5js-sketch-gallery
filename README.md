## Exploring Creative Coding & P5js
### Understanding Creative Coding
Creative coding refers to the use of programming to create art. It covers a broad range of artistic styles and techniques. In this repo I will be exploring the use of p5js to create generative art, music visualizations, animations and more.

### Introduction to P5js
P5js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of creating art through code. With its diverse range of capabilities, p5js allows artists to design and develop a variety of creative projects.
